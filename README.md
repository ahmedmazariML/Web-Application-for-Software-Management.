# Web-Application-for-Software-Management

Currently, the use of software has become essential and mandatory in the daily life of companies and organizations so as 
to contribute to the fulfillment and respond to the need of the fore-mentioned institutions. Realizing the need and the role 
that a software library can play, we opted for designing and implementing this library for the benefit of Bejaia University.

Modeling and design methods of our application are made by respecting the approach of Pascal Roques in his book UML2 process, 
through a functional and structural specification for the development. It is done with the PHP programming language using 
the Framework CodeIgniter in the Netbeans IDE.
